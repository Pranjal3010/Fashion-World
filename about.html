            We are all about tradition's, Rituals & Beliefs of all the people around the world. Our work is to keep
             you informed you all about the different Tradition's all around the World.
              <br>
            Traditional dress may be defined as the ensemble of garments, jewelry, and accessories rooted in the 
            past that is worn by an identifiable group of people. Though slight changes over time in color, form, 
            and material are acknowledged, the assemblage seems to be handed down unchanged from the past. 
            <br>
            Traditional dress or costume is a phrase used widely both by the general public and writers on dress. 
            It conjures up images of rural people dressed in colorful, layered, exotic clothing from an idealized 
            past in some faraway place. This notion of traditional dress has been scrutinized and found inadequate
             by many researchers and scholars, but its uncritical use continues into the twenty-first century.
             <br>
             The phrase traditional dress or costume is often used interchangeably with the terms ethnic, regional, 
             dress. For a concise discussion of this terminology see Welters and for a fascinating look at how the term 
             is used try a Web search on the words "traditional costume."

        </p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            In Webster's Third International Dictionary, tradition is defined as "an inherited or established 
            way of thinking, feeling or doing: a cultural feature preserved or evolved from the past"
             (1993, p. 2422; italics by author). 
             <br>
             The concept of traditional dress as a static form carried over from the past is usually contrasted
              with the rapidly changing fashion of "the West." Ethnographers and travelers documenting actual dress
               practices provided the original data for later interpretation by other researchers.
                Early social psychologists were primarily concerned with understanding the human element of fashion 
                , not with the continuity of a particular dress tradition, thus the reference to tradition or custom was
                 usually brief.
                 <br>
                 General studies of folk or traditional costume were geared toward showing the diversity and splendor of
                  peoples of the world while more recent, specific studies tend toward more historical and cultural 
                  analysis. Tarrant asks the pertinent questions, "What tradition?" and "How old is tradition?"
                   (p. 153), questions that are essential for studying and analyzing the cultural and historic
                    aspects of dress.
